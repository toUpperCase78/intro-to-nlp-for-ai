    "## Rule-Based Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment Analysis is a necessary process to understand the emotions or opinions expressed in texts. By analyzing these texts, we can classify them as positive, negative or neutral. This helps businesses and researchers track public mood, brand reputation or reactions to events in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule-Based is a practical approach to analyze text without training or using machine learning models. This results in rules based on which the text is labeled as positive/negative/neutral. These rules are also known as lexicons. TextBlob, VADER and SentiWordNet are widely used rule-based (lexicon-based) approaches."

    "Subjectivity score, on the other hand, goes from 0 to 1. If it's close to 1, it means the sentence has a lot of personal opinion instead of just facts."

    "VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a sentiment analysis tool which is designed to analyze social media text and informal language. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis methods, it excels at detecting sentiment in short pieces of text like tweets, product reviews or user comments which contain slang, emojis and abbreviations. It uses a pre-built lexicon of words associated with sentiment values and applies specific rules to calculate sentiment scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "VADER works by analyzing the polarity of words and assigning a sentiment score to each wordd based on its emotional value. These individual word scores are then combined to calculate an overall sentiment score for the entire text. It uses compound score which is a normalized value between -1 and +1 representing the overall sentiment."

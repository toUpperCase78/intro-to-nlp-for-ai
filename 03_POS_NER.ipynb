    "## Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "Parts of Speech (POS) tagging is a fundamental task in NLP, where each word in a sentence is assigned a grammatical category such as noun, verb, adjective or adverb. This process help machines to understand the structure and meaning of sentences by identifying the roles of words and their relationships. It plays an important role in various NLP applications including machine translation, sentiment analysis and information retrieval, by bridging the gap between human language and machine understanding."

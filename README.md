# Into to NLP for AI

Here, all the necessary methods for Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be found here to process given texts for many different tasks, separated into several notebooks, as well as the files used to provide texts to these methods.

Well, I've got to create such a repo for the preparation of understanding the concepts related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) subjects, like Deep Learning, Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Note:** All these notebook materials were actually taken from **Intro to NLP for AI** course (maintained by _365 Data Science_). But, I've added a few more cells to explore more about these methods and brief explanations to better comprehend how they all work.
